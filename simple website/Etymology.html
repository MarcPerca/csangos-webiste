        <p>It has been suggested that the name Csángó is the present participle of a Hungarian verb csángál meaning 'wander, as if going away'; purportedly by sibilation, in the pronunciation of some Hungarian consonants by Csángó people.</p>
        <p>Alternative explanations include the Hungarian word elcsángált, meaning 'wandered away', or the phrase csángatta a harangot 'ring the bell'.</p>
        <p>The Finnish researcher Yrjö Wichmann believed that probably the name of ceangău did not come from a certain Hungarian tribe, but they were called those Transylvanian Szeklers who moved away from their comrades and settled in areas inhabited by Romanians, where they were, both materially and ideologically influenced by them and even Romanianized to a certain level. Ion Podea in the "Monograph of Brașov County" of 1938 mentioned that the ethnonym derives from the verb csángodni or ecsángodni and means 'to leave someone or something, to alienate someone or something that has left you'. This was used by the Szeklers in the case of other Romanianized Szeklers from the Ciuc area.</p>
        <p>In some Hungarian dialects csángó, cángó means 'wanderer'. In connection with this etymological interpretation, the linguist Szilágyi N. Sándor made an analogy between the verb "to wander" with the ethnonyms "kabars" and "khazars", which means the same thing.</p>
        <p>According to the "Dictionary of the Hungarian Language", 1862; The etymological dictionary of the Hungarian language, Budapest 1967; The historical dictionary of the Hungarian lexicon from Transylvania, Bucharest, 1978; The Explanatory Dictionary of the Hungarian Language, Hungarian Academy Publishing House, Budapest, 1972; The new dictionary of regionalisms, Hungarian Academy Publishing House, Budapest, 1979, the terms csangó, csángó are translated in 'walker', 'a person who changes his place'.</p>
        <p>The historian Nicolae Iorga stated that the term comes from șalgăi, name given to the Szekler workers at Târgu Ocna mine.</p>
        <p>A theory of the historian Antal Horger relates that the ceangău comes from czammog, which refers to a shepherd who walks with the bludgeon after the herds. Another hypothesis of Bernát Munkácsi explains that the term comes from the verb csángani which in Ciuc County means 'to mix'.</p>
