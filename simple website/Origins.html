  <div class="description">
        <p>The Hungarian and the international literature in this subject unanimously agree that the Csángós are of Hungarian origin, with varying assimilated elements of Romanian, German, Polish and Italian.</p>
        <p>The Hungarians originated on the Asian Steppe, as a tribal federation composed of Ugric and Turkic peoples.</p>
        <p>The Csángós had historically been a rural and agricultural people, raising stock like sheep and cows and farmed crops such as corn, potatoes, and hemp. They were also often called for military service, protecting the Eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages. Before the Communist era and the collectivization efforts, the Csángós were structured in a traditional society until the introduction of civil code. Village elders were well respected and could be pointed out by their traditionally long hair and beards. Notably, some Csángós also participated in the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt and fought on behalf of Romania in both world wars.</p>
